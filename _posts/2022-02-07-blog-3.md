This week's blog plot practices web scraping and uses Python to code a spider to parse through the IMDb website.

2021-02-07

In this blog post, I’m going to make a web scraper, specifically we will be going through the IMDb page for *High School Musical*. This is a link to my project repository: [https://github.com/kellyc3/IMDB_scraper](https://github.com/kellyc3/IMDB_scraper). 

I set up this project by coding a spider using `scrapy`. The goal of spider is to crawl through the movie's IMDb site, starting at the movie's IMDb URL: [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0475293/](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0475293/). 

Next, we locate the Cast & Crew page and then we crawl through each actor's page to accumulate each of their filmographies. The spider finally creates a `.csv` file containing all the actors' names and respective filmographies.

To get started, open your terminal and run the following two lines of code:


```python
scrapy startproject IMDB_scraper
cd IMDB_scraper
```

Create a file inside the `spiders` directory called `imdb_spider.py` and start with the following lines of code:


```python
# import the necessary packages
import scrapy
from scrapy.spiders import Spider
from scrapy.http import Request

class ImdbSpider(scrapy.Spider):
    name = 'imdb_spider'
    
    start_urls = ['https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0475293/']

    prefix = start_urls[0]
```

Now we will define three methods to complete our task.


```python
def parse(self, response):
    nav_bar = response.css("div.SubNav__SubNavContentBlock-sc-11106ua-2.bAolrB")
    cast_box = nav_bar.css("li.ipc-inline-list__item")
    cast_link = cast_box.css("a:first-child").attrib["href"] # cast link is the first link 
    link = self.prefix + cast_link # the prefix is the start URL
    yield Request(link, callback = self.parse_full_credits)
```

This method navigates the page to select the Cast & Crew link on the site. We achieve a partial link `fullcredits/?ref_=tt_ql_cl` but we must append this to the start URL `https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0475293/` to arrive at the new link: [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0475293/fullcredits/?ref_=tt_ql_cl](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0475293/fullcredits/?ref_=tt_ql_cl). Now, we must call the next method to parse through the 


```python
def parse_full_credits(self, response):
    suffixes = [a.attrib["href"] for a in response.css("td.primary_photo a")]
    actor_urls = ["https://www.imdb.com/" + suffix for suffix in suffixes]
    for url in actor_urls:
        yield Request(url, callback = self.parse_actor_page)
```

Now that we are on the full credits page, we locate the actors' headshots to scrape the links to their IMDb pages. We are able to obtain the suffixes to all their URLs so we again must add the prefix to form a proper link. For example, Zac Efron's IMDb page is: [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1374980/](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1374980/).


```python
def parse_actor_page(self, response):
    # find the name of the actor
    name = response.css("h1.header").css("span::text").get()

    # go through each of the films
    film_rows = response.css("div.filmo-row")
    for row in film_rows:
        id = row.css("::attr(id)").get()
        if "actor" or "actress" in id: # determine that the actor/actress acted in this film
            # yield a dictionary
            yield {
                "actor" : name,
                "movie_or_tv_name" : row.css("a::text")[0].get()
            }
```

From each actor's IMDb page, we scrape the names of all the films they have acted in. Then, we finally yield a dictionary with the key values of `"actor"` and `"movie_or_tv_name"`. 

Now that the scraper is implemented, run `scrapy crawl imdb_spider -o results.csv` in the terminal and a `results.csv` file will populate in the respective folder. With our new data set, let's create a visualization.


```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv("results.csv")
df = df.drop_duplicates() # we want each actor listed with each movie once
df.head()
```




<div>
<style scoped>
    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {
        vertical-align: middle;
    }

    .dataframe tbody tr th {
        vertical-align: top;
    }

    .dataframe thead th {
        text-align: right;
    }
</style>
<table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: right;">
      <th></th>
      <th>actor</th>
      <th>movie_or_tv_name</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>0</th>
      <td>Da' Jon Lang</td>
      <td>High School Musical</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>1</th>
      <td>Roger Malaga</td>
      <td>Dear Dumb Diary</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>2</th>
      <td>Roger Malaga</td>
      <td>High School Musical 3: Senior Year</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>3</th>
      <td>Roger Malaga</td>
      <td>The American Mall</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>4</th>
      <td>Roger Malaga</td>
      <td>High School Musical 2</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>




```python
movies = ["High School Musical", "High School Musical 2", "High School Musical 3: Senior Year"]
hsm = df[(df.movie_or_tv_name == movies[0]) | (df.movie_or_tv_name == movies[1]) | (df.movie_or_tv_name == movies[2])]
hsm.head()
```




<div>
<style scoped>
    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {
        vertical-align: middle;
    }

    .dataframe tbody tr th {
        vertical-align: top;
    }

    .dataframe thead th {
        text-align: right;
    }
</style>
<table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: right;">
      <th></th>
      <th>actor</th>
      <th>movie_or_tv_name</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>0</th>
      <td>Da' Jon Lang</td>
      <td>High School Musical</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>2</th>
      <td>Roger Malaga</td>
      <td>High School Musical 3: Senior Year</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>4</th>
      <td>Roger Malaga</td>
      <td>High School Musical 2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>5</th>
      <td>Roger Malaga</td>
      <td>High School Musical</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>9</th>
      <td>Todd Michael Schwartzman</td>
      <td>High School Musical</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>



Now we have the dataframe `hsm` that contains all the actors that were in the three High School Musical movies. We can use the function `value_counts()` to count how many of the movies these actors were in.


```python
hsm_count = hsm['actor'].value_counts().to_frame('count')
hsm_count = hsm_count.reset_index()
hsm_count
```




<div>
<style scoped>
    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {
        vertical-align: middle;
    }

    .dataframe tbody tr th {
        vertical-align: top;
    }

    .dataframe thead th {
        text-align: right;
    }
</style>
<table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: right;">
      <th></th>
      <th>index</th>
      <th>count</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>0</th>
      <td>Lucas Grabeel</td>
      <td>3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>1</th>
      <td>Shawn Carter</td>
      <td>3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>2</th>
      <td>Chris Warren</td>
      <td>3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>3</th>
      <td>Bart Johnson</td>
      <td>3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>4</th>
      <td>Corbin Bleu</td>
      <td>3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>...</th>
      <td>...</td>
      <td>...</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>62</th>
      <td>Tisha Vaculin</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>63</th>
      <td>Camille Lynne Matthews</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>64</th>
      <td>Malinda Money</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>65</th>
      <td>Sabra Johnson</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>66</th>
      <td>Da' Jon Lang</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>67 rows × 2 columns</p>
</div>



We see that the number of movies acted in ranges from one to three. What if we wanted to see a list of actors who acted in all three High School Musical movies?


```python
hsm_count[hsm_count.iloc[:, 1]==3].iloc[:, 0]
```




    0       Lucas Grabeel
    1        Shawn Carter
    2        Chris Warren
    3        Bart Johnson
    4         Corbin Bleu
    5        Roger Malaga
    6     Raquel Goodsell
    7       Britt Stewart
    8         Kelli Baker
    9         Mollee Gray
    10        Bayli Baker
    11       KayCee Stroh
    12        Leslie Wing
    13    Monique Coleman
    14       Olesya Rulin
    15        Alyson Reed
    16     Ashley Tisdale
    17       Ryne Sanborn
    18    Vanessa Hudgens
    19          Zac Efron
    20     Charles Klapow
    21      Jared Murillo
    22         David Huff
    Name: index, dtype: object



Here we use `iloc` to locate the first and second columns. First, we determine the dataframe where the actor's count is 3. Then we take the values from the first column, which are the names of the actors. Now we have the original cast for all three movies!
