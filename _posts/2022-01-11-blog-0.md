This is a tutorial on how to create a histogram of the Palmer Penguins data set.

2021-01-13

1. Read the data into Python
2. Clean up the data
3. Plot the histogram

### Read the data 

First we read the data into Python with the code:
```python
import pandas as pd
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilChodrow/PIC16B/master/datasets/palmer_penguins.csv"
penguins = pd.read_csv(url)
```

### Clean the data

Now, to clean up the data, we run the following:
```python
# to remove entries that are missing data
penguins = penguins.dropna(subset = ["Body Mass (g)", "Sex"])
penguins = penguins[penguins["Sex"] != "."]

# keep only the first word of the species name
penguins["Species"] = penguins["Species"].str.split().str.get(0)

# select the columns we want to work with
cols = ["Species", "Island", "Sex", "Culmen Length (mm)", "Culmen Depth (mm)", "Flipper Length (mm)", "Body Mass (g)"]
penguins = penguins[cols]
```

### Plot the histogram

Today, our goal is to plot a histogram that is separated in three histograms that display the distribution of the penguins' culmen depth for each island, side-by-side. Then, we will use color to compare the culmen depth distributions of each sex within each island. 

```python
from plotly import express as px

fig = px.histogram(penguins,
                   x = "Culmen Depth (mm)",
                   color = "Sex",
                   opacity = 0.7,
                   nbins = 30,
                   barmode = "stack",
                   facet_col = "Island",
                   width = 700,
                   height = 300)

fig.update_layout(margin = {"r":0, "t":50, "l":0, "b":0})
fig.show()
```
